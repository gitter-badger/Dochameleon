From project name it is not hard to guess where the idea of Dochameleon is from.

With [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus) built and maintained by awesome team from Facebook, why do I want to build another one?

1. Dev server and site generation are written separately. Inconsistency is inevitable.
2. Pages can not share building blocks.
3. Big CSS file makes styling hard.

One personal reason is I am so excited about Docusaurus. Can't stop checking around, rewrite, restruct source code. So only rewriting can satisfy myself.

Some features are removed. Assumption is that many small open source projects don't need these.

1. Multi-Language support.
2. Project version support.
3. Search
