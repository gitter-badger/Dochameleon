Initially building Dochameleon was purely for fun. Writing code is like playing video game to me. [Docusaurus](https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus) was like a new game release. So just play.

Since Dochameleon is my own project I have the luxury to cut down, rewrite, in any way I feel right. Build the core first, then add features like search and analytics. I started to think, this is actually useful. In some areas it is even better than the awesome Docusaurus built by Facebook folks. (disclaimer: just some areas, not the whole project)

Why not put it online.

Register a domain with AWS Route 53; Create a CloudFront distribution in order to serve SSL certificate of its own domain instead of GitHub.

Then https://dochameleon.io is live!
